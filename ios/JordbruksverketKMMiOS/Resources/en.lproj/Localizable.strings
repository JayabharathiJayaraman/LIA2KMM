But you get the best view of your soil if you do all three parts. The test can be done at any time, but works best when the soil is moist.\n\nPlease do the test in different places in the same field to get to know your soil even better. Then you can compare good, representative and bad areas.";

It will help you develop a long-term strategy to improve the soil structure of your fields.\n\nIt is possible to export performed tests from the app, and to import them back, with position information. So you should be able to come back and follow up on previous tests.\n\nYou can also email individual test results as a PDF to yourself or, for example, an advisor. You can also create a PDF with a summary of your three subtests for a site.";
